## General .NET Core Questions

### 1. What is .NET Core and how does it differ from .NET Framework?

.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It's a part of the .NET ecosystem developed by Microsoft. The key differences between .NET Core and the older .NET Framework include:

- Cross-platform: .NET Core supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, whereas .NET Framework is Windows-only.
- Modular: .NET Core is modular and allows for the inclusion of only necessary packages via NuGet, reducing the footprint of the application.
- Open Source: Unlike the proprietary .NET Framework, .NET Core is open-source, allowing for community contributions.
- Performance: .NET Core generally offers better performance and efficiency.
- Side-by-side installation: Multiple versions of .NET Core can coexist on the same machine, allowing more flexibility in application deployment and maintenance.

### 2. Explain the concept of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in .NET Core.

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) in .NET Core is the virtual machine component that manages the execution of .NET programs. It provides important services such as:

- Memory management: Automatic management of memory allocation and garbage collection.
- Type safety: Enforcement of strict type-checking at runtime.
- Exception handling: Handling of runtime exceptions.
- JIT compilation: Just-In-Time compilation of .NET intermediate language (IL) code into machine code for execution.

### 3. What are the main characteristics of .NET Core?

- Cross-platform capabilities
- Microservices architecture support
- Modular and lightweight
- High performance and scalability
- Support for modern application patterns (e.g., cloud, IoT)
- Command-line interface tools
- Strong ecosystem with robust libraries and frameworks

### 4. How does garbage collection work in .NET Core?

Garbage collection (GC) in .NET Core automatically manages memory. It frees memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The GC operates on a generational model, categorizing objects into generations (0, 1, 2) based on their lifespan. It performs periodic collection runs, primarily focusing on newer objects (Generation 0) and progressively examining older objects (Generations 1 and 2) as needed.

### 5. Describe the role of the .NET Standard.

.NET Standard is a formal specification of .NET APIs intended to be available on all .NET implementations. The primary role of .NET Standard is to enable library developers to create portable libraries that are compatible across different .NET flavors like .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin.

### 6. What is a .NET Core Global Tool and how do you create one?

A .NET Core Global Tool is a special kind of NuGet package that contains a console application. Once installed, this tool can be called from the command line, regardless of the current directory. To create one:

- Develop a console application.
- Modify the project file to include necessary configurations for tooling.
- Pack the application into a NuGet package.
- Publish the package to NuGet.org or a private repository.
- Install the tool globally using the dotnet tool install command.

### 7. Explain dependency injection in .NET Core.

Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET Core is a design pattern and a set of built-in services that help to develop loosely coupled code. It involves injecting dependencies (like services or objects) into a class, rather than having the class create these dependencies internally. .NET Core has built-in support for DI, which simplifies the process of decoupling components and improving testability and maintenance.

### 8. Describe the differences between .NET Core and Mono.

- Runtime: .NET Core uses CoreCLR, while Mono uses Mono Runtime.
- Cross-platform: Both are cross-platform, but Mono historically targeted Linux and macOS before .NET Core was introduced.
- APIs: .NET Core supports .NET Standard more comprehensively.
- Performance: .NET Core typically offers better performance.
- Community and Support: Mono is primarily community-driven, whereas .NET Core is backed by Microsoft.

### 9. What are middleware in .NET Core?

Middleware in .NET Core are software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses. Each middleware component can perform operations before and after the next component in the pipeline. This design allows for a highly configurable request pipeline, essential for tasks like authentication, routing, session management, and logging.

### 10. Explain the Kestrel web server in .NET Core.

Kestrel is a cross-platform, lightweight, and high-performance web server used by .NET Core applications. It's built on the libuv library, which provides asynchronous I/O. Kestrel can be used as a standalone server or can be combined with a reverse proxy server like IIS or Nginx for production deployments. It supports HTTP/2, SSL, and other modern web server features.

## C# Specific Questions

### 11. What are the new features in C# 8.0?

C# 8.0 introduced several new features, including:

- Nullable reference types: To help avoid null reference exceptions by alerting developers when a reference type may be null.
- Default interface methods: Allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
- Pattern matching enhancements: Offers more expressive patterns in switch expressions and other pattern matching scenarios.
- Asynchronous streams (IAsyncEnumerable): Enables iterating over data that is asynchronously fetched.
- Indices and ranges: New syntax for indexing and slicing collections more intuitively.
- Null-coalescing assignment: A shorthand for assigning a value to a variable only if it is null.
- Static local functions: Local functions that don't capture any variables from the enclosing method.
- Disposable ref structs: Allows ref structs to be disposed at the end of a scope.
- Readonly members: Members of structs can be declared readonly, indicating they donâ€™t modify the state.

### 12. Explain the difference between Value Type and Reference Type.

- Value Types: Store data directly. They include simple types (like int, double, bool), struct, and enum. When a value type is assigned to a new variable, a copy of the value is made.
- Reference Types: Store a reference (or pointer) to the data. This includes types like class, string, array, and delegate. Assigning a reference type to another variable copies the reference, not the actual data, so both references point to the same data.

### 13. What is LINQ and how does it benefit developers?

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in C# that allows querying various data sources (like collections, XML, databases) in a consistent, SQL-like manner directly from C#. Benefits include:

- Simplified syntax: Query data without needing to use complex for-loops or lambda expressions.
- Strongly typed: Compile-time checking of queries.
- IntelliSense support: Makes writing queries easier with code completion.
- Unified approach: Consistent query experience across different data sources.

### 14. Describe async and await keywords in C#.

async and await are used to write asynchronous code in C# that mimics synchronous code's clarity and simplicity.

- async: Used to declare a method as asynchronous. An async method can contain await expressions.
- await: Applied before a task, suspends the execution of the async method until the awaited task completes. This allows other operations to run in the meantime, improving responsiveness.

### 15. What are extension methods in C#?

Extension methods allow adding new methods to existing types without modifying the original type's source code. They are static methods in a static class, with the this keyword before the first parameter type, indicating the type the method extends.

### 16. Explain the concept of delegates in C#.

Delegates in C# are similar to function pointers in C/C++. They are objects that refer to a method or a group of methods. They are type-safe and secure, allowing methods to be passed as parameters. Delegates are used for implementing events and callback methods.

### 17. What is the difference between a struct and a class in C#?

- Class: A reference type. When an object is created, memory is allocated on the heap, and the reference to this memory is stored on the stack. Classes support inheritance.
- Struct: A value type. Structs are stored on the stack, which can provide performance benefits. They should be used for small, lightweight objects. Structs do not support inheritance.

### 18. How do you handle exceptions in C#?

In C#, exceptions are handled using the try-catch-finally construct:

- try block: Contains code that may throw an exception.
- catch block: Catches and handles exceptions. Multiple catch blocks can be used for different types of exceptions.
- finally block: Optional, executed whether an exception is thrown or not, used to clean up resources.

### 19. Explain the concept of indexers.

Indexers in C# are a way to access elements in a class or struct that represents a collection of values. They use the same syntax as an array. Indexers are defined using the this keyword with the indexer's type and parameter.

### 20. What are generics in C#?

Generics in C# allow writing classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for the type of data they store or use. This makes them more flexible and type-safe without incurring the overhead of boxing or unboxing. Generics reduce code redundancy and improve performance for collection types.

## ASP.NET Core and Web Development

### 21. What is ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It's a redesign of ASP.NET that combines the MVC and Web API into a single framework. ASP.NET Core offers features such as:

- Cross-platform capabilities: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Built-in dependency injection: Supports loosely coupled and easily testable applications.
- Lightweight and modular: Gives developers the flexibility to include only necessary components.
- High performance: Optimized for high performance and scalable applications.
- Unified framework: Combines MVC and Web API, eliminating the need to choose between them.

### 22. Explain the MVC pattern in ASP.NET Core.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in ASP.NET Core is a way to structure web applications into three interconnected components:

- Model: Represents the data and business logic. It includes data and validation rules.
- View: Handles the display of information, typically through HTML and CSS.
- Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling user input and responses.

This separation allows for organized code, easier maintenance, and testability.

### 23. Describe Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core.

Razor Pages is a feature of ASP.NET Core that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive. It's a page-based programming model that offers an easier way to build web UI compared to the MVC pattern. Razor Pages are built around simple pages with a .cshtml extension, each containing a mix of HTML, Razor markup, and C# code-behind. This approach streamlines web development for scenarios where a full MVC framework might be unnecessary.

### 24. How do you implement authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core supports various authentication and authorization techniques:

- Authentication: Can be implemented using middleware, such as cookie-based authentication, JWT bearer tokens, OAuth, etc.
- Authorization: Defined via policies and can be applied globally, at the controller level, or action level. Custom authorization requirements can be defined using policy-based authorization.
- Identity: A membership system that adds login functionality to applications, supporting user creation, password storage, and user management.

### 25. Explain the role of ViewComponents in ASP.NET Core.

ViewComponents in ASP.NET Core are similar to partial views, but they come with the logic to generate the HTML content returned to the client. They are useful for rendering components of the UI that require some processing to display data, such as a shopping cart, user profile summary, etc. ViewComponents are reusable across different views and isolate the logic of rendering parts of the UI.

### 26. What are Tag Helpers in ASP.NET Core?

Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. They are a cleaner way of writing server-side code to render UI elements in ASP.NET Core views. Tag Helpers look like standard HTML tags but have server-side attributes. They are used for various purposes, such as creating forms, links, loading resources, and more.

### 27. Describe the use of Areas in ASP.NET Core.

Areas in ASP.NET Core provide a way to partition a large ASP.NET Core application into smaller functional groupings. Each area can have its own set of controllers, views, and models. Areas are used in large projects to organize related functionality into distinct sections, making the project more manageable and modular.

### 28. How do you manage sessions in ASP.NET Core?

Session management in ASP.NET Core involves storing user data while the user browses a web application. ASP.NET Core supports session state using cookie-based sessions or distributed cache sessions. Session data is stored on the server and is identified by a session ID passed in the browser's cookie. This feature is useful for storing user-specific data across different requests.

### 29. Explain SignalR and its applications.

SignalR is a library in ASP.NET Core that enables real-time web functionality. It allows server-side code to send asynchronous notifications to client-side web applications. The main applications of SignalR include:

- Real-time chat applications
- Live dashboards and monitoring systems
- Collaborative applications (like document editing)
- Real-time gaming, voting, or auction systems

SignalR simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality to applications.

### 30. Describe the role of Web APIs in ASP.NET Core.

Web APIs in ASP.NET Core are services that are accessible over HTTP and are designed to support device-independent data interchange. They play a crucial role in:

- Building RESTful services: They follow REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Creating microservices: They are ideal for building scalable microservice architectures.
- Interoperability: They can be consumed by a variety of clients, including browsers and mobile applications.
- JSON and XML support: They typically exchange data in JSON or XML format.
- OpenAPI (Swagger) integration: ASP.NET Core Web APIs can be easily documented and tested with tools like Swagger.

## Entity Framework Core and Data Access

### 31. What is Entity Framework Core?

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an open-source, lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework, which is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. EF Core allows developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations.

### 32. Explain Code-First vs Database-First approaches.

In Entity Framework Core:

- Code-First Approach: Developers start by writing C# classes (entities), and then EF Core creates the database schema based on these entities. It's suitable for applications where the database schema is evolving or when working without a database designer.
- Database-First Approach: Begins with an existing database. EF Core generates entity classes and DbContext based on the schema of the existing database. This approach is useful when working with a predefined database schema.

### 33. How do you handle migrations in Entity Framework Core?

Migrations in EF Core allow for incremental changes in the database schema to keep it in sync with the application's data model while preserving existing data in the database. The process typically involves:

- Creating a Migration: Running a command to generate code that can update the database schema.
- Applying a Migration: Running a command or using application logic to apply changes to the database.
- Reverting Migrations: If necessary, migrations can be rolled back to a previous state.

### 34. What are the different ways to query data using Entity Framework Core?

In EF Core, data can be queried using:

- LINQ Queries: The most common way, using LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to write queries against DbContext.
- Raw SQL Queries: EF Core allows executing raw SQL queries directly against the database.
- Stored Procedures: Calling stored procedures from the DbContext.
- FromSqlRaw and FromSqlInterpolated methods: To execute raw SQL queries for entity types.

### 35. Explain the concept of lazy loading in Entity Framework Core.

Lazy loading in EF Core is a pattern where related data is automatically loaded from the database when a property referring to the data is accessed. By default, EF Core uses eager loading. To enable lazy loading:

- Install the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies package.
- Enable it in the DbContext options.
- Make navigation properties virtual.

### 36. How do you handle concurrency in Entity Framework Core?

Concurrency in EF Core is handled using:

- Concurrency Tokens: Properties in entities marked as concurrency tokens (using attributes or Fluent API). EF Core checks these tokens when updating or deleting entities to ensure no other process has modified the data since it was fetched.
- Handling DbUpdateConcurrencyException: When a concurrency conflict occurs, EF Core throws DbUpdateConcurrencyException. This exception can be caught and handled to implement custom conflict-resolution strategies.

### 37. Describe the Repository pattern.

The Repository pattern is a design pattern that abstracts data access in the application. It provides a separation between the domain or business logic of an application and the data access logic. Repositories expose methods for querying and modifying data, allowing the rest of the application to be unaware of the underlying data access implementation.

### 38. What is Unit of Work pattern?

The Unit of Work pattern in software design is a way to group one or more operations (usually database operations) into a single transaction or "unit of work," so that all operations either succeed or fail together. In the context of EF Core, DbContext class acts as a Unit of Work, managing transactions and ensuring data integrity.

### 39. Explain how transactions work in Entity Framework Core.

In EF Core, transactions are used to execute a series of data manipulation operations as a single unit. EF Core automatically handles transactions for individual SaveChanges() calls. For more complex scenarios, transactions can be manually controlled using DbContext's Database.BeginTransaction() method, allowing for custom transaction scopes and error handling.

### 40. What are shadow properties in Entity Framework Core?

Shadow properties in EF Core are fields that are not defined in the entity class but are defined in the model, usually via the Fluent API. They are used to store data in the database without having to declare them in the entity class. Shadow properties are useful for keeping track of data like creation dates, modification dates, foreign key properties, etc., that do not need to be exposed on the entity class.

## Advanced Concepts and Best Practices

### 41. What are design patterns and can you name some commonly used in .NET Core?

Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They are best practices formulated over time by experienced software developers. Common design patterns used in .NET Core include:

- Factory Pattern: Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- Repository Pattern: Abstracts the data layer, providing a substitution point for the unit tests.
- Decorator Pattern: Adds new responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- Strategy Pattern: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- Observer Pattern: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.

### 42. Explain SOLID principles in software development.

SOLID is an acronym for five principles of object-oriented programming and design intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
- Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

### 43. What is Test-Driven Development (TDD)?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before writing the actual code. The process involves:

- Writing a test: Start by writing a test for a new function or feature.
- Running the test: Seeing the test fail (since the feature isnâ€™t implemented yet).
- Writing the code: Implementing the feature to pass the test.
- Refactoring: Refining the code while ensuring that tests still pass.

TDD ensures that the codebase is tested thoroughly and helps in designing cleaner and more efficient code.

### 44. Describe Microservices architecture and its benefits.

Microservices architecture is a method of developing software applications as a collection of loosely coupled, small, modular services. Each service is focused on a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Benefits include:

- Improved scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently.
- Flexibility in technology choices: Different services can be written in different programming languages.
- Resilience: Failure in one service doesnâ€™t bring down the entire application.
- Easier maintenance and update: Smaller codebases are easier to manage and understand.

### 45. How does Dependency Injection work in .NET Core?

Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET Core is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. In .NET Core, DI is built-in and works as follows:

- Registering services: Services (dependencies) are registered with the DI container in the Startup class.
- Injecting services: Services are injected into classes (like controllers, services) via constructors or properties.
- Lifetime management: The DI container manages the lifetime of dependencies (singleton, scoped, transient).

### 46. What is Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)?

CI/CD is a method of frequently delivering apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are:

- Continuous Integration: Developers merge/commit code changes more frequently, which are automatically tested.
- Continuous Deployment: Each change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to production.
- Continuous Delivery: An extension of continuous deployment where deployment happens manually.

CI/CD streamlines the process of releasing new features and fixes, ensuring a high level of software quality.

### 47. Explain the concept of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that centers the development on the core domain of the application and its logic, rather than the technology used to build the application. It involves:

- Modeling the domain: Understanding the business domain and creating a model that reflects its processes and rules.
- Ubiquitous Language: Establishing a common language between developers and domain experts.
- Bounded Contexts: Dividing the domain into distinct subdomains with clear boundaries.

DDD helps in creating complex systems by connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts.

### 48. How do you ensure the security of .NET Core applications?

To ensure the security of .NET Core applications:

- Authentication and Authorization: Implement robust authentication and use role-based or policy-based authorization.
- Data Protection: Use data protection APIs for encryption and secure data storage.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention: Validate and encode user input to prevent XSS attacks.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Implement anti-forgery tokens in forms.
- Secure Communication: Use HTTPS to secure data in transit.
- Dependency Management: Regularly update and review third-party libraries and dependencies for vulnerabilities.

### 49. What is the role of Docker in .NET Core development?

In .NET Core development, Docker is used for containerization, which packages an application with its dependencies and configurations into a container. The benefits include:

- Consistent environment: Containers provide a consistent environment for development, testing, and production.
- Microservices: Ideal for microservices architecture as each service can be deployed as a separate container.
- Portability: Containers can run on any system that supports Docker, easing deployment and scaling.
- Isolation: Containers are isolated from each other, reducing conflicts between running applications.

### 50. Describe how to optimize the performance of a .NET Core application.

To optimize the performance of a .NET Core application:

- Use Asynchronous Programming: Where appropriate, use async/await to improve scalability.
- Optimize Data Access: Use efficient queries, caching, and proper database indexing.
- Application Profiling: Use profiling tools to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.
- Memory Management: Monitor and optimize memory usage to prevent leaks and excessive garbage collection.
- Minimize Use of Blocking Calls: Avoid or minimize the use of blocking calls which can tie up thread pool threads.
- Optimize Services Configuration: Use appropriate service lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient) wisely.
- Use Response Caching and Compression: Implement response caching and compression to reduce the data transferred over the network.

## Practical and Coding Questions

### 51. How would you implement a singleton design pattern in C#?

A singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Here's a basic implementation in C#:

```csharp
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                {
                    _instance = new Singleton();
                }
                return _instance;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code uses a lock to ensure that only one thread can create an instance, making it thread-safe.

### 52. Write a C# method to reverse a string without using built-in functions.

Here's a simple method to reverse a string in C#:

```csharp
public static string ReverseString(string str)
{
    char[] charArray = new char[str.Length];
    int forward = 0;
    for (int i = str.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
    {
        charArray[forward++] = str[i];
    }
    return new string(charArray);
}
```

This method manually reverses the string by iterating over it backward and constructing a new string.

### 53. How would you create a custom middleware in ASP.NET Core?

To create a custom middleware in ASP.NET Core, define a class with an Invoke or InvokeAsync method. Here's an example:

```csharp
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Custom logic here

        await _next(context);
    }
}

// Extension method for adding the middleware
public static class CustomMiddlewareExtensions
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseCustomMiddleware(this IApplicationBuilder builder)
    {
        return builder.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
    }
}
```

You can then use this middleware in the Startup.Configure method.

### 54. Demonstrate how to use LINQ to filter a list of objects.

Using LINQ to filter a list can be done as follows:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

List<Person> people = new List<Person>
{
    new Person { Name = "John", Age = 30 },
    new Person { Name = "Jane", Age = 25 },
    new Person { Name = "Joe", Age = 40 }
};

var filteredPeople = people.Where(p => p.Age > 30).ToList();
```

This LINQ query filters people to only include those over 30 years old.

### 55. Write an example of an async method in C#.

Here's an example of an asynchronous method using async and await:

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetWebPageContentAsync(string url)
{
    using HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    string content = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
    return content;
}
```

This method asynchronously fetches the content of a web page.

### 56. How would you implement a custom exception class in C#?

To create a custom exception class in C#, derive from the Exception class:

```csharp
public class MyCustomException : Exception
{
    public MyCustomException() { }

    public MyCustomException(string message)
        : base(message) { }

    public MyCustomException(string message, Exception inner)
        : base(message, inner) { }
}
```

You can throw this custom exception as needed in your application.

### 57. Demonstrate the use of delegates in a practical scenario.

Here's an example of using delegates:

```csharp
public delegate void DisplayMessage(string message);

public class Program
{
    public static void ShowInfo(string msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Info: {msg}");
    }

    public static void ShowWarning(string msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Warning: {msg}");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        DisplayMessage messageTarget;

        messageTarget = ShowInfo;
        messageTarget("This is an informational message");

        messageTarget = ShowWarning;
        messageTarget("This is a warning message");
    }
}
```

In this example, DisplayMessage is a delegate, and ShowInfo and ShowWarning are its target methods.

### 58. Write a SQL query to retrieve data and explain how you would execute it in Entity Framework Core.

SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 30;
```

To execute this in Entity Framework Core:

```csharp
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var usersOver30 = context.Users
                             .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 30")
                             .ToList();
}
```

This code uses FromSqlRaw to execute a raw SQL query and retrieves the users over 30 years old.

### 59. Show how to implement basic authentication in an ASP.NET Core Web API.

To implement basic authentication in ASP.NET Core Web API:

- Create an authentication handler:

```csharp
public class BasicAuthenticationHandler : AuthenticationHandler<AuthenticationSchemeOptions>
{
// Implementation of the handler
}
```

- Register the authentication scheme in Startup.cs:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication("Basic")
        .AddScheme<AuthenticationSchemeOptions, BasicAuthenticationHandler>("Basic", null);
}
```

- Apply the [Authorize] attribute to your controllers or actions.

### 60. Write a C# program to demonstrate the use of generics.

Here's an example of a generic class in C#:

```csharp
public class GenericList<T>
{
    public void Add(T input) { }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var intList = new GenericList<int>();
        intList.Add(1);

        var stringList = new GenericList<string>();
